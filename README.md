the Metastatistical Extreme Value (MEV) Distribution and related
functions. The package was developed for application to rainfall daily data,
but the method is general and may be applied to different fields.

Dependancies: 
The package works with any version of Python 3 and requires a few common packages 
(numpy, scipy, pandas, and matplotlib). Recommended convention to import the package is 
'import mevpy as mev'
