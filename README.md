# MEV_python

A Python Package For Extreme
Value Analysis (in the following MEVP, Metatstatistical Extreme Value
Analysis in Python). This is a set of functions that implements the Metasta-
tistical Extreme Value (MEV) Distribution and related
functions. The package was developed for application to rainfall daily data,
but the method is general and can be applied to different fields. Some
example of applications to rainfall data are included.
